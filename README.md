# Braintree

### Your notes, your way

---

Braintree is a new type of note taking app which takes all your notes, and
aligns them in a graph as if it were your second brain. Braintree is
cross-platform, and can run on both MacOS and Windows.

You can use BrainTree to organise your to-do lists, or even as your personal
knowledge graphs. The only limits are your imagination.

Braintree uses react, d3, mobx and electron under the hood.
